Example.. So not for real use that much. 

Operates basically like the arduino serial monitor, but of course it is just an
example.

Try [picocom](http://code.google.com/p/picocom/) for a more serious tool.
(Although i dont see a stdin-operation in that one?) 
[inotool](http://inotool.org/) can also be handy as it figures out some of the
parameters.(And it is nice to not have to go through arduinos' UI)
